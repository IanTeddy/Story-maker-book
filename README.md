# 📕 Mattel® See ‘N’ Say Storymaker
Emulating a Classic Toy with a Web App


### 🚀 Feature

### 💭 Process
At first, use an approach that adds new \<p> to HTML, and delete that \<p> when refreshing it. However, it causes conflict because they also delete \<div> to store a newly selected phrase. Therefore, I changed an approach that set \<p> beforehand and updated it instead of adding and deleting multiple times.
