# ðŸ“• MattelÂ® See â€˜Nâ€™ Say Storymaker
Emulating a Classic Toy with a Web App

### ðŸš€ Feature
- By clicking the button, the built-in TextToSpeech API will read the words aloud (in every browser except MSIE â€“ but Edge is fine).
- There are 5 buttons â€“ each one will pick a random phrase.
- "Play story" button that concatenates those five words and reads out loud.
- "Random story" button that generates a random story with one click.
- A reset button so that another story can be created

### ðŸ’­ Process
At first, use an approach that adds new \<p> to HTML, and delete that \<p> when refreshing it. However, it causes conflict because they also delete \<div> to store a newly selected phrase. Therefore, I changed an approach that set \<p> beforehand and updated it instead of adding and deleting multiple times.
